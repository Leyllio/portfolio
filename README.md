# Mathéo Petry Portfolio

Master’s student in Computer Science at the University of Bordeaux. I create custom scripts, bots, and tools to automate tasks and simplify daily work.

## Projects

1. **AutoFileSorter** – Python script to automatically sort files by type.
2. **DiscordBot-Helper** – Multi-functional Discord bot (reminders, quotes, mini-games).
3. **DataCleaner** – Python tool to clean and format CSV files.

Each project is detailed in its respective folder with source code and instructions on how to use it.
